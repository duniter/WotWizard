# WotWizard

WotWizard builds, from the blockchain and sandbox of Duniter, a prediction of the future entries of candidates into the Duniter Web of Trust (WOT). It uses a simulation of the Duniter mechanism. When several possibilities may happen, each one is listed with its probabilities. The published lists are automatically updated every five minutes, and any change is signalled visually.

Several other tools are provided, such as a fast Web of Trust Explorer.

This program needs that a Duniter node runs on the same computer.
This program runs natively on Windows. If your computer runs on Linux, install "wine" first, and, in a terminal, run "winecfg" and configure the drives to be sure that the Duniter database (see below) can be reached.

You can find the executables here:
	https://github.com/duniter/WotWizard/releases

WotWizard may be used as well as a server, or as a stand-alone application with a front-end.

The version of the associated Duniter node must be 1.7.17 at least.
