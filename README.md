# WotWizard

WotWizard builds, from the blockchain and sandbox of Duniter, a prediction of the future entries of candidates into the Duniter Web of Trust (WOT). It uses a simulation of the Duniter mechanism. When several possibilities may happen, each one is listed with its probabilities. The published lists are automatically updated every five minutes, and any change is signalled visually.
