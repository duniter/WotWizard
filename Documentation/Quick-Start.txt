WotWizard: A predictor for future entries into the Duniter Web of Trust.

WotWizard (WW) builds, from the blockchain and sandbox of Duniter, a prediction of the future entries of candidates into the Duniter Web of Trust (WOT). It uses a simulation of the Duniter mechanism. When several possibilities may happen, each one is listed with its probabilities. The published lists are automatically updated every five minutes, and any change is signalled visually.

2	How to use it?	 Up

This program needs that a Duniter node runs on the same computer.
This program runs natively on Windows. If your computer runs on Linux, install "wine" and "winetricks" first, and, in "winetricks", run "winecfg" and configure the drives to be sure that the Duniter database (see below) can be reached.

Put the file "WotWizard.exe" into an empty directory, put the Windows dll "sqlite3.dll" into the same directory and run WotWizard with a double-click. The dll can be found at the address:
	
	https://www.sqlite.org/2015/sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3081002.zip

Choose your language in "Edit->Preferences...".

Open WordWizard with "Duniter->New WotWizard View". When this command is used for the first time, WotWizard asks you where the Duniter database lies. A first window pops up with the text "Choose Duniter Database". Click on "OK". Then, a new window lets you navigate to the database file. E.g. on Linux, the path of this file is:
	
	~/.config/duniter/duniter_default/duniter.db

You can:
	- choose the way the list is displayed (by names or by dates)
	- manually update the list (it's automatically updated every five minutes)

After the first opening of WotWizard, a part of Duniter data is copied into a new database, to accelerate their future use. This operation may take a rather long time, and you'll can see, at the bottom of the application, the block numbers pass before your eyes.

When the list has changed, two asterisks appear, one on each side of the title, and a new button "Checked" is created. Click on the button to make the marks disappear.
You can save the list with "File->Save" or "File-> Save as...", and reopen it with "File->Open". Unlike the command "Duniter->New WotWizard View", this method makes appear the marks if a change happened since the last save command, even if WotWizard has been stopped meanwhile.

If the list is too long to compute, it may not be displayed. In this case you may want to increase the maximum computing time with "Edit->Change Max Computing Time".

In rare cases, you may want to change the path to the Duniter database. Use "Edit->Change Duniter Database".
You may, rarely too, want to reset the database WotWizard builds from Duniter. In this case, use "Edit->Reset WotWizard Database". Warning: this operation may be long.
