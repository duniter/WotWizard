Pseudo-random number generator. At load time, every generator is initialized with a random seed. A default generator may be used, or a new one created.

TYPE Generator
LIMITED
A pseudo-random generator.

PROCEDURE (g: Generator) Random (): REAL
NEW
Generate, with the generator g, a new pseudo-random real number x such that 0 <= x < 1, with uniforme deviates.

PROCEDURE (g: Generator) GaussRand (): REAL
NEW
Generate, with the generator g, a new pseudo-random real number x with gaussian (normal) deviates. Probability distribution p(x) = 1 / sqrt(2 * pi) * exp(-x^2 / 2): mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. Use the Box-Muller method.

PROCEDURE (g: Generator) Randomize (seed: INTEGER)
NEW
Initialize the pseudo-random number generator g with seed.

PROCEDURE New (): Generator
Generate and return a new pseudo-random generator.

PROCEDURE Random (): REAL
Generate, with the default generator, a new pseudo-random real number x such that 0 <= x < 1, with uniforme deviates.

PROCEDURE GaussRand (): REAL
Generate, with the default generator, a new pseudo-random real number x with gaussian (normal) deviates. Probability distribution p(x) = 1 / sqrt(2 * pi) * exp(-x^2 / 2): mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. Use the Box-Muller method.

PROCEDURE Randomize (seed: INTEGER)
Initialize the default pseudo-random number generator with seed.
