How to build wwServer from sources?

1) We suppose that you've already installed go and that your go workspace is "$HOME/go" (see golang.org/doc/install).

2) Install github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 (see https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)

	$go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
	
3) Copy the content of github.com/duniter/WotWizard/Go into $HOME/go/src.

4) Open a terminal in $HOME/go/src/duniter/wwServer and execute:

	$go build

The file $HOME/go/src/duniter/wwServer/wwServer is created.

5) Copy the file $HOME/go/src/duniter/wwServer/wwServer in a new empty directory (see the WotWizard manual for further explanations: github.com/duniter/WotWizard/Help/Manual.en.pdf)
